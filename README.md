1) Pregame class is the script which handles info being sent by an Android with the app. 2) Scores set ups Android Mobie as client and connection with server. It sends info from mobile Android. Obviously we add some GUI elements like a joystick and buttons to the Android app. 3) NetworkManager allows to set main computer as server to handle incoming info from clients. HOW IT WORKS: Networkmanager set ups a server connection, and it displays an IP address, which the player who wants to join the game enters on mobile app. After that, once virtual / GUI button on Android is pressed, it will send the info to the computer-server and Pregame will handle that info, so player with mobile may use mobile as a gamepad.
